description:
  HaNS is a lightweight, pure Haskell network stack that can be used for Haskell
  networking in the context of the HaLVM, or with a Linux tap device. It's very
  cool, but can be hard to integrate into existing systems. This library
  attempts to mitigate some of the translation cost by mimicking some of the
  behavior of the standard Haskell network library.
